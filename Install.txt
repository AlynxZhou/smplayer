This document explains how to compile and install SMPlayer.

Compiling SMPlayer should be easy. It only depends on Qt 4.


1) How to make a deb package
2) How to make a rpm package
3) Generic compilation
4) Changing installation path
5) How to compile in Windows


1) How to make a deb package
----------------------------
You need to install a compiler and some development packages:
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev fakeroot build-essential devscripts debhelper g++

You also need either Qt 5 or Qt 4.

This will install the development packages of Qt 5:
sudo apt-get install qtbase5-dev qt5-qmake qtscript5-dev \
                     qttools5-dev-tools qtbase5-private-dev qtdeclarative5-dev \
                     libqt5webkit5-dev libqt5opengl5-dev --no-install-recommends
(note: libqt5webkit5-dev is only necessary if you're going to build smtube as well)

It's still possible to build SMPlayer with Qt 4, although not recommended:
sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev

Now run ./create_deb.sh


2) How to make a rpm package
----------------------------
Building a rpm package is not easy. Better get a binary package from
this repository:
https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Asmplayerdev&package=smplayer


3) Generic compilation
----------------------
(obsolete)


4) Changing installation path
-----------------------------
By default smplayer will be installed in /usr/local. You can change it by
using PREFIX and DESTDIR.

Examples:
make PREFIX=/usr
make PREFIX=/usr install

That would install smplayer under /usr.

DESTDIR will be useful for package maintainers.

make PREFIX=/usr
make PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=/tmp/ install

That would compile smplayer for /usr but in fact it will be installed in
/tmp/usr/
